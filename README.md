# godogpaw

`godogpaw` is a UCCI(Universal Chinese Chess Protocol) engine, implemented in Go.

Why is it called `godogpaw`? It from the book "I Think, Therefore I Laugh":

> The dog moves his rook to KB4 with his paw. George moves his queen to QB6 and 
> announces, "Checkmate. That was a stupid move, dog. Besides having bad breath, 
> you’re really dumb. I’ve beaten you five out of seven games."
